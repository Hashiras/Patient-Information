## FAQ

#### Is the project complete and functional?

This practice exercise aims to test our ability and understanding about the basic CRUD operations. This means that the scope of the project is just limited into the CRUD operation and hence the project was **completed**. 



#### Why are there only two modules?

As previously mentioned, this project's goal is only to test our knowledge regarding the basic CRUD operations and therefore, all other modules of a hospital system were purposedly omitted.
